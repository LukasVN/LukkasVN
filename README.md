- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LukasVN
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in videogame development, programming and english.
- ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently on my first year in a professional training of Mult-Platform App Development.
- ðŸŒ± At the moment the only programming language that I'm learning is Java because it is the one that we use in the course, but I'm looking forward to learn C# or C++ 
      and Unity/Unreal in the future. 
- ðŸ’» This account will contain my class projects/activities (Public and in spanish) and personal projects (Private).
