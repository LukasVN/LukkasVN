- 👋 Hi, I’m @LukkasVN
- 👀 I’m interested in videogame development, programming and english.
- 📚 I’m currently on my first year in a professional training of Mult-Platform App Development.
- 🌱 At the moment the only programming language that I'm learning is Java because it is the one that we use in the course, but I'm looking forward to learn C# or C++ 
      and Unity/Unreal in the future. 
- 💻 This account will contain my class projects/activities (Public and in spanish when I finish them, you can ask me to see them before uploading them if interested)       and personal projects (Private).
- 📫 How to reach me --> lucasvnbusiness@gmail.com
